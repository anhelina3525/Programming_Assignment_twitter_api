# Task 1 - Working with a JSON file
In this task we import a module twitter2.py in which,
with the help of Twitter API, we get a json file
that contains information about accounts that a user-given (argparse
is implemented) account is following and navigate through it.

# Task 2 - Website
This program allows you to see locations of people that a certain account
is following displayed on an html map. 
[Here's](http://anhelina.pythonanywhere.com/) what it looks like, just enter any twitter account
and press 'Enter'.

The different tools and libraries that were used in the project: Flask (to generate a web server),
Twitter API (a specific endpoint, to get information about followings), folium (to generate a map),
geopy (to find latitude and longitude of a location).

Here's how the starting page looks:
